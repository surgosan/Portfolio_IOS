# Portfolio for IOS

Just like my original portfolio, I have recreated this portfolio as an IOS application.

## Development

For this project, I used XCode on an iMac Mini for development and then I ran it on my iPhone 13
Pro. This has helped me better understand how front-end development works on the IOS platform
with design as well as get requests for my database. 

## Small Features

In addition to serving static content in my _Home_ and _About_ tabs, the _Project_ tab and links in
the other tabs all work to easily access projects or sites such as my socials, GitHub, LinkedIn, and
some live projects.

## Demonstration

Just like my original IOS application, I do not expect for everyone to have an iMac to clone
and see my application for themselves. Thus, I will display it here. 

Last time, I used a GIF file to display it since it would provide a smaller footprint. This
time, I am using Git LFS to move large files such as the following MP4.
